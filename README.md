# open-keylogger
Welcome to simple python keylogger.
Keylogger saves logs to file, and sends them to your email.
To set it up you need to provide email and password encoded in base64 in vairables.py.
Remember to provide rcvEmail in main.py, another way the program won't send the logs.
Do not use this keylogger for anything illegal, it's made for legal testing purposes only!
Have fun!
